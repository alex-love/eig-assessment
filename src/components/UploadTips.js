          <h3>How to Take Helful Pictures:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>-- Use as much light as possible. Open curtains or blinds, or use a light source to allow for clarity</li>
            <li>-- Hold your camera as still as possible. If needed, steady it on a firm surface or use a tripod</li>
            <li>-- Ensure that your camera has focused. Especially in low light, this may take a second</li>
